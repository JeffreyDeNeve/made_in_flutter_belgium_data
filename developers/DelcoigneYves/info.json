    "description": "Hello! I started my journey in the mobile world with native Android, which I soon expanded with Windows Phone (I know right). With this experience, the transition to Xamarin was easily made. Always on the lookout for the best solutions for the job, I found out about Flutter when it was reaching the first beta release, and have been working with it since then.",
